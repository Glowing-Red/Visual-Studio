            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h3>Hello, I go by the alias 'Glowing-Red' and I am currently learning about coding and web-design. 
                The purpose for this website was to expand my knowledge and skills in both programming but also flexbox, 
                the primary goal was to make a blog website using flexbox for a good and stylish layout, the website was supposed to consist of 3 pages: introduction, blogs and about me.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Although I did have those three things in my website, I did not do as per the intstructions and instead had the introduction and blogs in the same page. 
                The reason as to why is because I decided to first do some research about the layout of various blog-sites, and also image what I myself would like to see in a website such as this. 
                And the result was that the blogs are usually at the index page so you see them when you open the website.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                And thus I decided to make the introduction with a large image and then text to catch the users attention and make them see that first,
                next to that I added a brief showcase of the About Me to entice the user into reading more about it.
                I later on used the same trick by displaying the blogs as a small card-like structure where I have the title of the blog,
                and then an image of it to make it look appealing, and then below it I have a brief introduction to what it contains, 
                below the blog introduction I added a button that the user can press if they want to continue reading about the specific blog, it's both easy and appealing to the eye.
                And that's not all, I even changed the style of the button go from a black white one to make it stand out by using the blurred out blog image as background to make it fit each blog card theme.
            </h3>
            
            <h2>What is CSS Grid and Flexbox?</h2>
            <h5>
                CSS Grid is a 2D dimensional grid system used to divide an area into rows and columns which you use to decide what content takes up what content takes up what grid in the designated layout.
                The way it works is that you decide some content to start at a specific row and column, and then end at another specific row and column, which results in it taking up all the space between those 2 points, 
                for example if i have 3 rows and 5 columns, and i decide to put my text in the middle top by telling it to start at the first row, second column, and then end at first row, 4th column.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                CSS Flebox on the other hand, is a 1D dimensional layout system that provides an efficient way to align items and content in either a horizontal or vertical direction.
                Flexbox is generally more flexible and customizable than grid because you have multiple options about how to align the items, an example of this would be that you can choose how to align the items by making use of Justify-Content to decide whether the items should aligns themselves in the middle or on either the left or right side.
